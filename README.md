# Web scraping
***

## Python libraries
- [Scrapy](https://scapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/) is one of the oldest and perhaps the most widely known tool. Selenium development began as early as 2004. This began as a tool for functional testing and the potential of web scraping was soon realised. The biggest reason for Seleniumâ€™s is that it supports writing scripts in multiple programming languages, including Python. It means that you can write Python code to mimic human behavior. The Python script will open the browser, visits web pages, enter text, click buttons, and copy text.
